# Conduct Initial Performance Benchmarking on Critical Endpoints

Use #file:./generic-prompt.md as a basic prompt, please.

## Extended Description
Validate system responsiveness by running performance benchmarks on key endpoints (e.g., dynamic ingredient search and log entry submission) to ensure the PoC meets baseline performance requirements.

## Technical Details
- Use performance testing tools such as Apache JMeter to simulate load (targeting at least 50 requests/second on critical endpoints).
- Monitor response times and ensure that the 95th percentile is kept below 500ms.
- Analyze Neo4j query performance using the `EXPLAIN` command to identify and eliminate potential bottlenecks.
- Document benchmark results along with recommendations for any necessary performance improvements.
