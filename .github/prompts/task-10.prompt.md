# Develop PoC Technical Documentation and Runbook

## Extended Description
Create comprehensive documentation covering architecture design, API contracts, deployment instructions, and troubleshooting tips to ensure clear knowledge transfer and future maintenance.

## Technical Details
- Develop an ADR.md file using Michael Nygard's template to document key technical decisions made during the PoC phase.
- Generate architecture diagrams (e.g., using the C4 model) illustrating interactions among Neo4j, SpringBoot, Thymeleaf, and HTMX.
- Write setup guides for developers detailing local environment configuration using Docker Compose and integration testing procedures.
- Integrate Swagger (via springdoc-openapi) to provide interactive API documentation accessible at `/swagger-ui.html`.
