# Implement Dynamic HTMX-Enabled Ingredient Search

## Extended Description
Develop a responsive search feature using HTMX to provide live ingredient suggestions, making the user interface more interactive and efficient during ingredient logging.

## Technical Details
- Create a Thymeleaf fragment (e.g., `searchResults :: resultsList`) to display search results dynamically.
- Integrate HTMX attributes in the search input element (e.g., `hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:300ms"`, `hx-get="/ingredients/search"`) for real-time queries.
- Ensure that updates include ARIA live region attributes for accessibility compliance.
- Validate the dynamic search behavior through UI tests and debouncing logic verification.
