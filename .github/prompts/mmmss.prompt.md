Break implementation tasks into minimal verifiable units. Each code change must:

- Modify ≤3 files
- Maintain passing test suite
- Keep application runnable
- Address one specific requirement from:
    - Neo4J schema evolution
    - Spring Boot service method
    - HTMX component interaction
    - Thymeleaf template fragment

Prioritize atomic functionality over performance optimization. Provide implementation candidates that:

- Pass existing unit tests unchanged
- Require ≤25 new lines of code
- Include associated test updates when modifying behavior
