Use #file:./generic-prompt.md as a basic prompt, please.

## Extended Description
Build a comprehensive automated testing suite covering unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests to ensure the robustness of the PoC functionalities. This task supports continuous integration and code quality standards.

## Technical Details
- Write unit tests using JUnit 5 for backend services such as the Nutrient Calculator.
- Use `@SpringBootTest` and `@DataNeo4jTest` to create integration tests verifying controller actions and database interactions.
- Utilize headless browser test frameworks to validate HTMX-driven dynamic updates.
- Integrate testing into a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) with a targeted minimum code coverage of 80%.
